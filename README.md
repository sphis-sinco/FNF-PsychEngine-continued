The original Engine aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders, ended production on March 31st of 2025. Now to be continued in this version!

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](/docs/BUILDING.md)

## Customization:

If you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can refer to the `Project.xml` file.

Inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking.

To start you off, disabling *Video Cutscenes* should be simple, simply delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this: `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

Same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file.

## Softcoding (.lua/.hx)
For this you can head over to [the wiki](https://sphis-sinco.github.io/psychenginecontinued.lua/)

There you can learn how to use the 212 PlayState funcions in your mod!
